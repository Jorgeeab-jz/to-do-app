# to-do-app
A To-Do app for the assignment from The Odin Project.

It should work with LocalStorage to keep data between sesions.
I will take my time in this project to finish it in a very complete state.

Hopefully i should be able to apply what i have been learning on The Odin Project.

Project start 2/26/2021.
