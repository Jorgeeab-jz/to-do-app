# to-do-app
A To-Do app for the assignment from The Odin Project.

It should work with LocalStorage to keep data between sesions.
I will take my time in this project to finish it in a very complete state.

Hopefully i should be able to apply what i have been learning on The Odin Project.

Project finished 3/5/2021. (2 hours of work/study each day);

To-Do App:

-Tasks can be added with a set date.
-Tasks will be sorted by date putting the closest to the top.
-The 'complete' button will change the status of the task between 'complete' and 'completed'
